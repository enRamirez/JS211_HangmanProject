The computer will get a random word at the start of each game
  - Computer will count the amount of letter and display blank place holders for each letter

User enters a letter 
  - I will need to get the letter from the DOM
  - The btnClick function will need to be defined in .js

The selected letter needs to be checked to see if the letter is part of the random generated word
  - I'm going to need to convert the word into an array of letters
  - Then i will need to loop through the array and compare each element to the guess letter
  - 

If it is in the word then the letter needs to be put in the right place
  - 'Find the ID of the 

If not then add 1 to the wrong guess counter

Once the wrong guess counter gets to 6 then the game will end, resulting in an alert saying "Better luck next time"

Add a reset button for the user to clear board and new word
